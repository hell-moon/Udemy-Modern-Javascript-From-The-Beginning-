# Udemy 'Modern Javascript From The Beginning'

The **Task List** Project creates a web-based to-do list. 
Features include: adding tasks, filtering tasks, removing a single task, and removing all tasks.
All tasks added are stored in the browser's local storage, and removed from local storage when removed. When the page loads, an event listener gets any tasks stored in local storage and displays them.   
This project demonstrates DOM selection and manipulation with Javascript, event listeners and event delegation, and javascript functions. MaterializeCSS and Font-Awesome responsible for styling. 

To run: make sure both 'app.js' and 'index.html' are in same directory.  Then, just open 'index.html' in web browser.
